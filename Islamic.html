            <li>When you feel sad, pray.</li><br>
            <li>It was Allah who saved me every single time.</li><br>
            <li>Allah's timing is perfect, you are either being impatient or that thing is not really going to benefit you.</li><br>
            <li>Whith Allah by your side, you will never feel alone.</li><br>
            <li>If you got your mother's prayers,<br>you have got everything, and more.</li><br>
            <li>Remind yourself this life is a test.</li><br>
            <li>When you get what you want, thats Allah's direction.<br>When you dont get what you want, thats Allat protection.</li><br>
            <li>Put Allah first, and you will never be last.</li><br>
            <li>Don't be sad, Allah's by your side.</li><br>
